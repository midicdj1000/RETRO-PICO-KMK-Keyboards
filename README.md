# RETRO-PICO-KMK-Keyboards
My collection of PICO powered retro keyboards

My video https://youtu.be/a0VU5mklIbk

To use these scripts you will need
Circuit Python
KMK Firmware
https://circuitpython.org/
https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware

rename the file you want to code.py and copy over to the PICO after installing KMK firmware.
These are all setup for MiSTerFPGA cores with the keys as best as I can, the Spectrum core only uses the keys from the rubber keyboard.

I have included my PCB for the BBC project and you can find the files for that at https://github.com/ajparsons/bbc-micro-keyboard
The AMiga 600 I mention in the video can be found at https://github.com/thinghacker/Amiga600KeyboardUSBAdapter
