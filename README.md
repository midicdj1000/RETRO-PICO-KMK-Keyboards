# RETRO-PICO-KMK-Keyboards
My collection of PICO powered retro keyboards

To use these scripts you will need
Circuit Python
KMK Firmware
https://circuitpython.org/
https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware

rename the file you want to code.py and copy over to the PICO after installing KMK firmware.
These are all setup for MiSTerFPGA cores with the keys as best as I can, the Spectrum core only uses the keys from the rubber keyboard.
